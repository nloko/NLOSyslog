NLOSyslog
=========

NLOSyslog is an Objective-C wrapper around the asl (Apple System
Log) inteface.

It provides a simple means to search the system log. 

Filtering
=========

The following filter criteria is available:

Time 	- x number of seconds back in time
Sender 	- a substring of a sender
Message - a substring of a message

Criteria is combined using logical AND

Example Usage
=============

    // Filter for messages logged in the past hour
    // containing 'SpringBoard' in the sender text
    // and 'wallpaper' in the message text
    //
    // Get the log asynchronously and provide a block
    // as a callback for the results

    [[[[[NLOSyslog syslog] 
                        filterSecondsFromNow:60 * 60] 
                       filterForSendersContainingString:@"SpringBoard"] 
                      filterForMessagesContainingString:@"wallpaper"] 
     sendRawLogToBlock:^(NSArray* log) {
         for (id entry in log) {
             NSLog(@"%@", entry);
         }
     }];

Notes
=====

The NLOSyslog class is fairly straightforward and well-documented. Blocking
and non-blocking log retrieval methods are provided.
